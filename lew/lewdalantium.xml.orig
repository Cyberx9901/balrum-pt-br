What do you do here?
We create charcoal out of wood. People heat their homes with it. We also smelt ores here. Why are you interested?
I'm looking for a decent armor. Could you make one for me?
I cannot make you an armor I'm not a blacksmith. But I can make special metal bars for you. The toughest armor you can make is made out of dalantium. If you bring me raw dalantium, I will smelt it four you for 500 thalers. And when you have enough you should find a master blacksmith who can make armor out of it for you.
If I find any, I will bring it. Thank you.
