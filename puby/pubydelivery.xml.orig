I have a delivery for you people.
Who are you? I don't know you, you, you, you.
The boys at the farm could not make the delivery. I'm delivering for them.
Why would they send a cow to deliver our mahoka?
A cow? What are you talking about?
I never knew that I can speak to cows, cows, cows. My life would have been way different if I knew I can talk to cows. Tell me cow. Do you have some milk, milk, milk?
Here. Take the package.
