Leonard sent me to collect the mushrooms that you owe him.
That's it! I knew I had forgotten something. Sadly, I don't have the mushrooms on me. I used all of them yesterday.
I can't go back empty handed to Leonard. He was a bit angry with you.
Darn it. I can't leave my experiments unattended right now.
We have to figure out something. Are you sure you have nothing left? There are lots of plants lying around here.
No, there aren't any left. I have an idea! You can go and collect the mushrooms yourself? They usually grow in groups. They have a light pink color. You can't miss them. You need to find 5 of them.
All right Barnabas, I will do your work and collect the mushrooms for Leonard.
What's in it for me, If I do the work instead of you, Barnabas?
Thank you, son. Come back if you find all five of them.
End.
Well I can give you one of my fine potions.
All right Barnabas, I will do your work and collect the mushrooms for Leonard. That potion better be good.
