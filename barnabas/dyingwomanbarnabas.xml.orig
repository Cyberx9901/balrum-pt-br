Barnabas! A woman is awfully sick. Her eyes are turning yellow. She's so weak she cannot move. She needs a special potion to heal her!
Yellow eyes? There's no cure for that I'm afraid. Wait! The bark that you collected for me might help her. It's worth a try! Here, give this potion to her. Let's hope it will work.
Thank you.
