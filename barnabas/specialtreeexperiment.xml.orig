Did you find out anything about the silver tree?
It's fascinating! The sample that you gave me is filled with life essence. It's incredible. And also very dangerous. In the wrong hands it might act like a weapon. All kinds of potions can be brewed with this ingredient. Wait. What were you asking?
I was asking you about the bark that I gave you.
Yes, yes. It is an alchemist's dream. To find a substance like this. I never even heard or read about anything like it. It's so pure I might almost say it's holy.
What use do we have for it?
Right now I have to experiment more. Time will tell what it's capable of, but I think it will be able to heal even severe diseases!
End.
