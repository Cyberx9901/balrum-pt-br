I'm looking for work. Do you need anything?
The other day I saw a tree that was different from all of the trees I've ever seen in my whole life. It was almost like silver. The whole tree was sparkling. Can you fetch me a sample of it's bark?
Sure! Where can I find this tree Barnabas?
What's in it for me Barnabas?
Go straight south from my house. You can't miss it.
It's for all of us. My experiments will extend our lives by many years. This place is filled with life energy. But if you really want something, I can give you one of my potions.
I'm on my way.
