How are you today?
I'm fine thank you.
Do you need anything? I'm looking for work.
As a matter of fact yes, I do need help. A few days and we will be celebrating my husband's birthday. Edgar collects everything, but his passion for art is the strongest of all. Every year he surprises me with something great. This year I want to get him something fabulous! He loves statues and has always complained that he doesn't have a statue of an animal yet. Could you find me a statue of an animal?
If I find a statue I'll tell you about it.
Thank you! He would be so happy.
End.
