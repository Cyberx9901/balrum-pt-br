I'm looking for work.
Good. I have something that needs to be done. I want to explore the cave nearby, but the place is crowded with giant frogs from the swamp. You look like a capable fellow. If you deal with those creatures I'll teach you how to survive in the wild. Don't ask for money. I don't have any.
I'll try to deal with the frogs.
