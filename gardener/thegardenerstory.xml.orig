How are things?
Same old same old. Why is a young man like you interested in my wellbeing? I haven't seen you around, boy. Who are you?
I'm an adventurer. I live in the forest on my own.
I see. You know I've seen many things in my life, boy. I've seen how fear can change people.
What did you see?
When these poor unfortunate simpletons invaded the city the members of the royal court ran as fast as they could. Some of them tried to gather their valuables, but they all died. The smarter ones left as fast as they could. Leaving everyone behind. Not even trying to defend the castle.
You stayed here? Why didn't they kill you?
They needed someone who knows the castle inside and out.
Take care.
