Why are you living here?
Welcome young man. My name is Orran. I haven't seen a single soul for years. What can I help you with? And to answer your question I wanted piece. The desert keeps the rebels away.
What do you do here?
Not much. I used to be a sailor. Well if I think about it, I still am a sailor. You want to leave Balrum? That's why you sought me out?
Where can you take me?
I cannot go on long trips any more. I'm too old. But I can sail you to the nearest island if you want to. Crocodile Island is the name of the place. I must say it is a fitting name.
Sail me there Orran.
Not so fast young adventurer! I will need some compensation. At my age even a short trip can be really dangerous. I will need two thousand thalers from you boy. No more. No less.
I will think about it.
