What is this place?
Greetings, young man. My name is Norcross. I'm the custodian of the old monastery.
Can you tell me about the monastery?
I certainly can. The monastery was built centuries ago to please the old gods. These walls were home for many monks of the realm. The life of a monk is a life of serenity. A life of giving and healing. Countless times the monks of this monastery helped the people of the realm. They were there to help at every turning point in Balrum's history.
Can you tell me more?
My memories have faded, my son. Feel free to look in the library if you are looking for documents about the history of this great monastery.
Thank you father.
Don't mistake us for priests. We are not priests, my son.
End.
