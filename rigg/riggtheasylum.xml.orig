How are things in the asylum?
Welcome, welcome! Thank you so much for asking. The asylum and its patients are exceptionally well, thank you.
I heard screams. Are you sure everything is fine?
Nonsense! You are in an asylum, my child. There ought to be a few screams. You see, the poor souls who live here are quite unstable. We are the ones who make their life a little bit bearable. You see, there is no cure for their illness.
How do you know that there is no cure?
My predecessors tried to find a cure. They all failed. I decided to help these people and not to experiment with them. I think that's enough for today. Thank you for visiting.
End.
