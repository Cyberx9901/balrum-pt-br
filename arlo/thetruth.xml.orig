I spoke with the necromancers Arlo. I know about your deal with them and I know who I really am.
I told you, boy, to stop poking around! Why didn't you stop?
It doesn't matter. It would have happened eventually. They have planned this all along. They killed the Packs.
It's my fault. I thought that if I lock them down there they cannot harm us. I thought they were only crazy witches. Kyler and Leonard tried to warn me, but I didn't listen. Darkwood was my idea. I only tried to protect you and the others. I was a fool. I don't deserve to wear the king's armor. I don't deserve to live.
You did what you had to do. All these years we lived in harmony. You saved us. It's my turn to protect the villages from the necromancers.
What did they say? What are they going to do?
I have to bring them their remains back to Darkwood. They told me that I'm the only one who can find them. They won't harm anyone. They will wait for my return.
I'm afraid that is true. King Triston hid their remains in magically sealed places. Only the descendants of the royal bloodline may enter them. Only you can carry out this task. Let's hope the necromancers stand by their promise. I will talk to Kyler and we will look out for the villages. What are you going to do now?
I have to leave Darkwood and start the search for the remains. Do you know anything about their whereabouts? Where should I start?
I have no idea. Leonard should know something. The mages' guild sealed the hiding places and Leonard was a member of the guild. When the rebels overran the kingdom the guilds disbanded. I hope that over the years the mages have found a way to keep the guild alive. If you find the remaining members of the warriors guild tell them I sent you and say the words 'Guardians of the light', but don't tell them that you are the prince! You never know who might be listening and the rebels were really mad when they could not find you, because it meant they could not end your bloodline.
Why did the rebels invade the kingdom? Was my father a bad ruler? Why did they hate us?
We don't know, son. Your father was a just king. They started their attacks right after we dealt with the undead hordes close to our borders. After our battles with the undead we were exhausted and the rebels took advantage of this. Don't reveal your identity to anyone, boy!
Take care of everyone, Arlo. Be vigilant, because the portal to the city is open. They made the runes useless.
We will do our best. I wish you luck on your journey. Now go speak to Leonard.
End.
