I heard about the torches. Believe me, Aron has nothing to do with the fires. The torch that we use at home didn't start the fire because it's on a wall that wasn't burned at all.
The torches are the only explanation. I had problems with my own torches.
How can you say that? I told you that our torch at home has nothing to do with the fire. Something else started it.
Calm down, child. Tell me, what do you think? How did the fire start at your house?
I don't know. But I will find out.
