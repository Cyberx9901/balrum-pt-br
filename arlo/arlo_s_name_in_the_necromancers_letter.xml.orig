I know that you talked to the necromancers, Arlo.
What are you talking about?
I found a letter at the top of the old tower. Necromancers were talking about you in it.
What nonsense are you blabbering about? How did you get into the tower? 
Leonard gave me the key. I know that you did something Arlo, and I will find out what it was!
Stop! Whatever you are doing it has to stop!
Tell me, Arlo, what happened when the people entered the woods!
Leave me, you insolent kid. I'm not going to listen to this nonsense any more!
Fine. Let's take the harder path, Arlo. I will be back.
