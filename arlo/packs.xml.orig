Any news about the Packs?
Sadly, nothing. If they are in the woods I fear for their lives. All kinds of monsters live in Darkwood. Fox saw a troll the other day. Let's hope for the best for their family.
Did they leave the woods? They went back to the world ruled by bandits? Why would they leave this safe village? Would they be so cruel as to risk a worse life for their child?
If they left the village to go back to their old lives, then that is their decision. We don't know anything for certain, child. I doubt they would have left without any warning. Let's hope they'll be found.
End.
