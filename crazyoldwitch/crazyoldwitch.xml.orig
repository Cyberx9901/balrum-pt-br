What are you doing down here?
I live here. What are you doing here?
Why do you live down here? You could live in one of the villages. It would be a better life. Not to mention it would be much safer.
I don't like people. I lived here all my life. Well there was a time when I lived with my husband. But that was long ago.
Don't the wild animals scare you? I saw a giant spider here and a few larvae.
Why would they scare me? They are my children.
Your children? What do you mean?
'The woman in black smiles at you.' I told you they are my children. You look a little too old but you will do! 
End.
