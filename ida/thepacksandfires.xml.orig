Have you heard about the Packs and the fires Ida?
Yes my dear boy. It is terrible. The Pack family is missing. I can't believe this. How can something like this happen?
I don't know Ida. Let's hope they find them soon. Have you heard or seen anything strange?
Not that I can think of. That poor little girl Audie. I saw her growing up and now she is nowhere to be found.
End.
