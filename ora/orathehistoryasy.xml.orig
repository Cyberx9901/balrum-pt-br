How are the patients?
As usual. I hope Ed won't be doing his shenanigans today.
What does he do?
He sneaks out to the outhouse and... He grabs... Let's not talk about that.
Can you tell me about the history of the asylum?
I don't know much. You might find a few documents lying around here.
Thank you.
