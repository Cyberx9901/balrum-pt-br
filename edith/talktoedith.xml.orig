Hi Edith.
Hi there. How are you today?
I'm fine thank you. I just wanted to make sure you're alright.
I'm fine thank you. I was thinking about you, so here I am.
As you see, everything is fine. Mother is preparing the fields for the second sowing. The weirdest thing happened last night. I had a dream, and you were in it.
That is kind of you. Last night I had a dream, and you were in it.
A dream? What kind of dream? What happened in it?
We were eating honey bread; everything was beautiful, and suddenly Osric came of out of nowhere riding one of his big pigs.
That is a weird dream. Did anything else happen?
Yes, there was more. I barely remember, but suddenly the flowers and plants around us rotted. That's it. What could it mean? What do you think?
Dreams are sometimes completely illogical. I don't think that it meant anything.
You might be right. Thinking back to the image of Osric riding a pig is really funny.
See you later.
I was hoping that you would say that.
I have a few things to do right now Edith, but it would be lovely.
I know you are busy with a lot of things. Helping your grandfather is a noble thing to do. Maybe someday we will have a nice meal together.
Someday we will Edith. Take care.
