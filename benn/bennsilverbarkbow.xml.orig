I'm looking for work.
I'm looking for work, too.
How so?
There is not much to do lately. I'm a carpenter and since I was a child I have been making bows. Would you like to buy one of my bows? Or maybe I could make you a new one?
I don't need a bow.
What kind of bow could you make?
I want to make something really special. The old woodcutters told me about materials that were like shiny silver. They say that these things have been touched by the gods. If I could get enough of it I might be able to make a bow out of that substance. There are all kinds of things that have that strange silver material on them. Rocks, trees even bushes. What do you say?
Where can I find some and how many do you need?
That is the hard part. I haven't found any in all my years. And the more you can get the better, since I don't know the material. I don't know how much it would take to create a bow. I think you should bring me at least three pieces.
Fine. If I find them, I will bring them to you.
Great! I don't expect you to come back with them soon. It won't be an easy task gathering them all, but I think it will be worth your time.
End.
As you wish.
End.
