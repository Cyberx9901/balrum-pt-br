Gail told me to talk to you. I need to find the remains of the Darkwood necromancers.
A newcomer with an interesting mission. Why do you seek the remains?
I have my reasons. I would keep them to myself.
Fair enough. Our guild has no library, for obvious reasons. We don't like to keep records of our endeavors. What you seek is secret knowledge. Only the mages' guild knows where the remains are hidden. I think we can make something happen here.
I'm listening.
You must know by now that most of our members use teleportation devices. We could make you a device which would teleport you into the mages' library. There you would find the information you seek.
Can you make me such a device?
I could with the help of Daralis. But it won't be easy to convince Daralis to help a newcomer.
I will speak to Daralis. I have to convince her to help.
Good luck.
End.
