Cardew thinks you stole his blue ring from him.
Cardew is a lunatic. I have nothing to do with him, and nothing to do with no ring.
He told me you stole his ring. Why would Cardew lie? I don't even think he is able to lie, Rhys.
I'm a fool. I get caught by the village idiot. What a joke, right?
So you admit you stole it?
I admit, I admit. Fine. It's worthless anyway. Here, take it.
Why did you steal it from him?
The poor knucklehead told me it has magical powers. I was bored and wanted to take a look at it. First I asked, but he didn't wanted to show it to me. I asked again, but he refused. So when he went out of his house I snuck in. I didn't think he would immediately turn back and see me, but he did.
But why did you keep it?
Everyone knows. I guess your grandfather didn't tell you. Back in the day I was quite a famous thief. I like to steal stuff. It's in my veins. My mother and my father were thieves too. Proud thieves who stole from the fat rich bastards.
You're a thief?
I just told you.
Right. Thank you for giving the ring back.
It's worth nothing.
Can you teach me a few things?
Ah, so you want my help now do you? What's in it for me?
What do you want?
I'm making a new tool for myself and I need some perfect pine wood for it. Bring me four pieces of perfect pine wood and I might consider teaching you a thing or two. Perfect pine wood is rare so you might need to chop down quite a few pine trees.
What tool?
None of your business. Will you help me or not?
Alright. I'll bring you the wood you need.
