I never saw you work Rhys. Not for a single day.
Mind your own business. Why do you have to poke your nose into everything?
Everyone in this village has a job. Everyone does something to make our village better except for you.
Do you want to piss me off? That's what you want? 'Cause you are doing famously. Leave me alone.
Why, do you have something to do?
That's enough. Get out.
End.
