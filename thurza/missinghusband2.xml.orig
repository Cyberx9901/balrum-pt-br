Robert didn't go home. Do you know where he might be?
That old drunk. I saw him tottering near the Bear's den close to Fred's inn.
Thursa seemed really upset. She told me she wanted to tell Rupert something really important. Do you know what?
I think she's pregnant! At least thats what Selena told me. A few nights ago I heard screams coming from their house. I hope he didn't hurt her.
I'm going after him.
