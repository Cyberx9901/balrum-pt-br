You seem upset Thursa! What's the problem?
Thank the gods! I was just about to go and try to find you! Robert has not come home yet! He went hunting two days ago and I haven't heard of him since! This never happened before, something must have happened! I need you to and find him! I should have told you sooner, he's been drinking even more lately. I have something really important to say to him.
Your husband is an excellent hunter, I doubt anything bad happened to him.
I'm surprised that this doesn't happen more often. He's a drunk, still you love and care for him. I will go and find him!
I'm really sorry Thursa, but I don't have time for this.
Thank you! Bartok might know where he went. Please hurry!
