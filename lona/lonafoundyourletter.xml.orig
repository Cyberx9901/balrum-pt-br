Is this the letter you were looking for?
Could it be? 'Lona takes a look at the letter and smiles.' It is! How did you find it? Thank you so much. 'Lona bursts into tears but I can see they are tears of joy.' I lost everything I loved. You brought back a piece of him to me. Thank you.
You are welcome Lona.
