Is this a school?
It is. You must have a really sharp mind.
No need to be hostile. I'm looking for work.
I cannot offer you anything in return. The school barely keeps up. The rebels don't care about education. Thankfully some of them do help us out here and there.
You are wasting my time.
I don't need payment. What do you need?
We need more books. During the siege people took most of our books and burnt them because wood was running out because the rebels surrounded the city. If you find books suitable for children please give them to me.
I will keep an eye out.
Thank you, stranger. You're not as bad as I thought.
End.
Get out of here.
End.
