Are you a hunter?
What do you think?
I don't think so.
I'm on my first mission.
What kind of mission?
The kind where one has to remove something that causes trouble for someone else.
I think I know what you mean. Why would a young woman like you decide to do such a thing?
When you grow up on the streets pickpocketing people for a few thalers you grab the first opportunity that could change your life. Someone noticed my street skills and decided to perfect them and to put them to good use.
Can I say or do something to make you change your mind?
There is no going back. I have been training for years now. The kind of people who trained me won't allow me to simply quit. I know you won't believe me, but they are good people. We do great favours for the realm. Either way, these things have to be done. If I don't do them someone else will.
I understand.
I feel I can trust you. I'm looking for a man. A horrible man who hurt many women. He's the one who causes trouble for a lot of people. He runs a gambling den somewhere underground. Sometimes he 'invites' young women to his parties. He is worse than the rebels. I have to go now. Keep your eyes open and don't trust anyone.
Wait!
