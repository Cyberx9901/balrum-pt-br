I'm looking for work.
Welcome, young man. I don't need any help at the moment, thank you. I can tell you something curious if you are interested?
I'm listening.
I have been hearing noises lately. Every time I go near the abandoned houses I hear strange noises.
What kind of noises?
I don't know, really. They might be sounds of a rat or some similar creature, but where does the sound come from?
I have no idea.
I tell you, there is something underground. People always talked about a secret passage beneath the city that the nobles used when they escaped. I bet the sounds come from there.
You might be right.
