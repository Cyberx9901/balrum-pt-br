Who are you? How long have you been down here?
My mission was to clear this cave. My commander told me that the witches carved out these caves with their bare hands. As I got down it became obvious that he was lying. This cave has been properly designed and built by people who knew what they were doing. The wild witches could not have built it. I think this was some sort of a training facility for them.
Do you need any help? What happened?
It's been so long. They cursed me you know. For years I thought that I died but then how could I be speaking to you? I cannot talk about my mission, but I can tell you that I failed. Did we succeed? Are the woods cleansed?
I don't know. I..
It doesn't matter. I have to accept my fate. You should accept your fate too.
What do you mean?
