I'm a novice. I'm looking for work.
A novice! We hadn't had a novice in decades. I have to warn you. I like to have my fun with novices. Are you still interested in doing your novice work for me?
Do I have a choice?
Yes! You don't. Ha ha! Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh. But I did. I laughed loud and hard. Listen carefully. Do you see that man over there in the red robes? His name is Gar. When Gar goes to sleep sneak up on him and wake him up! Simple, right? That's all I need from you!
If I do this for you, would you tell Van that I would be a worthy addition to the guild?
Sure, sure! Of course! Now go! Leave me alone.
End.
