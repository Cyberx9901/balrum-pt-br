I talked to your son.
What happened?
A churn of milk went wrong early. Your son is cleaning the churn right now. It won't happen again.
I hope it won't happen again. I'm going to tell Garett to taste every churn before he sells them. Thank you for looking into this. Here is the money. Please take it to Adia.
End.
