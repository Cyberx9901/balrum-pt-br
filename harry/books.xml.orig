You have a lot of books in your home.
You're right. Books expand your mind and protect our great achievements. If I could do only a single thing until the day I die it would be reading. Reading hundreds and hundreds of magnificent books.
I'm looking for work. Do you need anything?
Not really. But if you find any books you could bring them to me and I'll buy them from you for a very good price!
If I find a book I'll bring it to you.
