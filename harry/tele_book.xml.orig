Look at this book, Harry.
'Harry looks at the book you have found and immediately drops it to the ground.' This book is evil! I think it might be a teleportation book.
A teleportation book?
This is a book that, when read, will teleport the person holding it to an unknown place.
How do you know this?
Because I saw a book like this once. Before we entered Darkwood my dear friend Otello found a teleportation book. And he read it. It was my fault. I told him to read it. I haven't seen him since that day. Books can be dangerous sometimes. Especially books that you find here in Darkwood. Do not read it under any circumstances, boy!
End.
