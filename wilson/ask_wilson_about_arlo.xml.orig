I know that Arlo had been talking to the necromancers.
Keep your voice down, boy! I knew one day someone would find that out.
I know that you are a loyal soldier, Wilson. But lives are at stake. We might be able to help the Packs if we act now. Tell me everything you know!
When we fled to the woods twenty years ago Kyler's and Arlo's people started to build a large village together. Something happened between them, and one day Kyler announced that his people would leave the village and build a second village on the other side of the woods. Arlo never talked about it.
What could have happened?
I already told you more than I should have. This is all I know. If you listen to me you should go and visit Kyler in the other village. You might find answers to your questions there.
Thank you, Wilson. I'll get to the bottom of this.
