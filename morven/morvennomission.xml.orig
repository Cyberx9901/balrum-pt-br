Can we speak now?
Luckily for you none of them was harmed. You cannot speak of this to anyone. They are only children and they are safe down there. Who are you?
I need to find the remains of the Darkwood necromancers.
An interesting mission. Max told me you were kind with them. You were able to find the children; you might be just the type we are looking for.
Just the type? What are you saying?
I will tell you more if I can trust you. Do me a favor. The rebel fools stay away from the capital's church for some reason. They haven't looted it. I know that there is a valuable ornament in that church. If you can bring it to me I will know that you are to be trusted.
Who do you think I am? A lowlife thief? I won't steal from the church!
If I do this will you help me in my mission?
Fine. I made a mistake. You are not our kind of person.
End.
Let's not be hasty. If you do this I will consider helping you.
End.
