Are you in charge of this farm?
Sure! Are you interested in some mahoka?
Mahoka?
Weed. We call our weed mahoka. It's so special it has to have its own name. We harvest the weeds early, when they are young. Then we dry them for weeks with smoke. Not some ordinary black smoke. We burn pinewood. So, are you interested?
Yes. I need a pack.
Good. Good. Look here. Usually we charge a lot for our product but you are in luck! The goofy people in the asylum ordered a large pack. My men here are unable to deliver the package. They smoked a little too much you see. Take this package to the asylum and I will give you a pack for your troubles.
I have no time to be a delivery boy.
Give me the package. I will deliver it for you.
Alright. Then you can buy a pack from me anytime you want!
Alright. Thanks.
Alright then take it. My boys might be out of it now, but the effect will fade and if you cheat on me they will find you.
End.
