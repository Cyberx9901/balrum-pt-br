I'm looking for work.
I heard you helped Eliza. I trust you are not a rebel, are you?
I'm not a rebel. Not even close.
Can I trust you, boy?
I guess you will send me on a mission so I can earn your trust. Am I right?
Ha ha! You are right, boy! I was going to ask you for a favour, but I have a good feeling about you so it's not necessary. The only thing I have to know about you now is that you can make hard decisions. Like, who lives and who dies.
What are you talking about?
These rebels are milking every single person in the realm. They are the worst. Many of us have already fled the kingdom. I have heard stories about what they did to women after they captured the castle. Not only that, but they killed most of the nobles. If you don't believe me, just go to the church and look around. They've moved into the houses that belonged to the nobles.
What are you planning?
I have been working on this for years. I might be able to get rid of most of them if I poison the wheat.
That is mass murder, old man!
I'm an old man alright but I will never forget what they did. Will you help me or not?
I won't be a part of this.
Those bastards will pay. What do you need?
Some day I will have my revenge, boy.
End.
I need a poison they cannot detect. Their alchemist always checks the food. The only poison they cannot identify is snake poison. We will need a lot of it.
How much do you need?
Bring me ten of their fangs. Each of them needs to be full of poison.
How many of them will die?
They will soon realize that something's wrong. Not all of them will eat from the poisoned food. I know what we are doing is wrong, but I hope we kill many of them.
I will be back with the poison.
Be careful, boy. I await your return.
End.
