How are things today?
Are you invited too? My name is Eric. I'm so excited!
Yes I am!
Invited?
I'm sorry I talk too much. Please leave. I have important things to do.
End.
I knew it. You have that look about you. Where are you from? Oh I'm sorry, it's none of my business, right? I hope we won't stay in the basement again. I would love to see the upper quarters of the castle. Wouldn't you?
Yes, it would be great. When will we have to go? And I'm silly, I know, but I forgot where the entrance is.
Ohh you are silly. You silly man. We just go to the castle and they will tell us what to do next. We have to go at sundown. Now don't you forget again, you pretty face, you! I have a great idea! Why don't we go together? Come here at sundown and we will go together. How great is that?
Alright. I will be here at sundown.
