What are we supposed to do here, Eric?
You silly boy. Enjoy yourself. It's a party after all, isn't it? Wait a minute. I know what this is. Do you want to have some fun with me?
Don't be offended Eric, but no.
I guess so.
Follow me, you silly boy, you.
End.
No hard feelings, silly. Enjoy yourself.
End.
