How are you today?
I'm exhausted. This crystal is making a racket. I don't even remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. Only Adacus can tell when Hugh will finish with the damned thing.
I might be able to help you with your problem.
Do what you have to do. I don't care. Just make it stop!
End.
