You look like you need help.
There is nothing I can do now. Nothing can change the past. Everything would have been much better. I would be a high mage of the mages' guild by now. They kicked me out because of my so called uncontrollable temper. I told them that it's his fault, not mine. Everything is his fault.
Who are you talking about?
My brother. Ronius Stockius. Our parents died when we were young. He took everything he could and left me alone. He left me alone in our empty home. Nothing. He left me nothing! Can you imagine what I had to do to make a living? I had no skills. I was only a young child. I swore that one day I would have my revenge.
That is horrible. I'm sorry for what happened to you. But things are fine now, aren't they?
Fine? You call my life 'fine'? I was meant to be a high mage! One way or another I will have my revenge! You don't look like those nitwits up in their mage tower. Hmmm. You could help me!
Help you with what?
With my revenge! Take everything from him. The only thing valuable to him is his research. He's not going to discover anything, the fool! But his papers mean everything to him. Better still! Kill him! Yes, kill him! What do you say?
I think I will leave now.
I knew you wouldn't help me. Get out!
End.
