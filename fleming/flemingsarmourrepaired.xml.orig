I'm back Fleming.
Welcome! Where is my armour? I hope your blacksmith took good care of it!
I'm sorry Fleming but your armour is ruined. Aron could not save it from the rust.
Aron did a fine job! Here is your shiny new armour, Fleming. Your father would be proud. Use it for good.
What? You are lying! Where did you hide my armour? Tell me now!
Thank you, fellow adventurer. May our paths cross again some day.
I'm not lying Fleming. Aron smelted down your armour into 10 ingots.
Smelted down my armour? 'Fleming's eyes turn red, but not because of anger - he is fighting back tears.' Father told me that I would never be like him. He was right. I'm not even a proper adventurer. I'm only roaming these woods like a coward. My adventures end here.
End.
