Who are you?
I'm a great adventurer. You must have heard of me. My name is Fleming.
I have never heard of you, Fleming. I'm sorry.
That can't be. Well then, have you heard of my father Linwood?
The knight who single handedly killed a giant bear?
Yes. Yes! You see, you know me after all.
I only know your father. What are you doing here?
I'm from Kyler's village and I'm on a great adventure. Just like my father.
Your armour looks a little loose, and it has already started to rust.
My father was much larger than me, but I'm feeling bigger every day. Some day I will be even bigger than him. But I don't have time to go to a blacksmith. Maybe you could help me. Do you know a great blacksmith? Because I'd only let a master blacksmith touch my father's armour..
I know one, his name is Aron. He is the best blacksmith you can find here in the woods. He crafted fine weapons and armour before we settled in Darkwood.
I see. Then he should be fine. So would you take my armour to him?
Yes, but I don't think it will be cheap to repair a suit of armour in such bad condition.
Of course. A fine armour like this needs special attention, and that's not cheap. What do you think. How much?
100 thalers would be enough.
200 thalers will be enough.
On second thoughts he might even repair your famous armour for free. 
Here you are. I'll be around here. Please take special care. This armour means a lot to me.
Fine. That blacksmith better be worth it. Please take special care. This armour means a lot to me.
That was what I was thinking. Any blacksmith would be happy to work on my famous armour for free. Take it. Please take special care. This armour means a lot to me. And here is 50 thalers for your time, fellow adventurer.
End.
