I'm back, Fleming.
Welcome! Where is my armour? I hope your blacksmith took good care of it!
I'm sorry Fleming, but I wasn't able to repair your armour at Aron's.
At least you tried. That's what matters, fellow adventurer!
I'm sorry Fleming. Here is your armour.
My good old armour! Now back to the adventure! Thank you for trying to help. Walk safely and sometimes stray away from the road!
End.
