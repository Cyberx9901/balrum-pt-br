Is everything alright, father?
Horrible! Horrible! Some lowlife thief stole our precious ornament. How dare he?
He must have had his reasons.
How do you know he was a man?
How do you know, father?
Never mind. The old thing was worthless anyway.
Let's hope the thief won't come back for more, father.
Don't scare me, boy.
End.
