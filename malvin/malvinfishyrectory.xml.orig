How are things, father?
It's a fine day isn't it, dear son. I haven't seen your face before. I welcome you to our church.
I'm looking for work.
You could help me in something. I suspect that it is a rather sensitive case. Can I trust you with such a matter?
I will handle this delicately, father. You can trust me.
Lately I have been hearing... well... noises. How can I say this to you son. Noises... Noises of pleasure, I assume. Noises of great pleasure.
I'm sorry father but I don't understand. Can you be more specific?
You know when a woman and a man...
I understand now father.
This kind of activity is banned amongst our members. What makes matters worse is that I strongly suspect the women involved are... you know... working.
What do I need to do, father?
I've got it all planned out. Listen carefully. Tell my brothers that you have heard that there are rumors about newborns without fathers. And you are really scared because you have been to the brothel a few times. One of the children might be yours. Ask them what to do. I think that will scare them enough. What do you think?
Sounds like a good plan, father.
Now you don't have to speak to the girls. Simply tell my little story to my brothers, alright?
What will I get in return?
I will teach you what I have learned over the years. I know quite a few spells, you know. What do you say?
I will talk to them, father.
Thank you, my son. Now off you go.
End.
