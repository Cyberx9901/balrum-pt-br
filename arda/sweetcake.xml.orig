Do you need any help around the house, Arda?
It's just another boring day. Nothing to do really. But I might be able to sweeten up the day with a nice cake, don't you think? I don't even remember the last time I made a melon cake. Everyone in the village loves it. No wonder, it's full of sugar! I have all the ingredients for it but one. I don't have any watermelons. Could you bring me three watermelons? In return I will give you two big slices of the cake!
It's a deal! We have a ripe watermelon on our fields at home, so I only need to find two more!
Make it three large slices and we have a deal.
Great! I'm going to prepare everything. 
All right. It's a deal. I'm going to prepare everything.
End.
