Do you need any help?
I'm glad you asked. You know that what little we have, we have because of our bees. We sell the honey they make.
Yes I know.
Well, all of the bees are dead. Some disease must have killed them. Can you bring us a few bees so we can start a new colony?
Of course I'll help. I'll come back with some!
Thank you, my boy.
