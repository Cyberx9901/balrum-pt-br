I'm back from the hunt. Here are the two pieces of meat I promised to bring.
Thank you, my boy. I don't know what would we do without you. Thank the gods for this long life they gave us. Together we are almost a hundred and eighty years old you know.  Each day you grow stronger. We saw you growing up. Your grandfather raised you to be a decent, honest man. What do we owe you, my boy?
Don't be silly. You owe me nothing. Here's the meat. Salt it well.
10 thalers should be more than enough.
Grandpa told me I should ask for at least 10 thalers.
Thank you, son. The meat looks delicious. We should make a good goulash tomorrow!
Here is your well deserved payment. The meat looks delicious.

Take care.
