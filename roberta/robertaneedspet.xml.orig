Good day to you.
Greetings, young man. My name is Roberta. What can I do for you?
I'm looking for work. Do you need anything done?
I could use a young man around the house like yourself. Let me think.
...
Hmm... ahh
...
Mmm... Yes, I need your services, young man. You know I have been living in this house alone for a very long time. I was thinking maybe a pet would brighten my gray days. What do you think young man?
I think it's a good idea, Roberta!
A pet might be a heavy burden at your age.
You might be right. Silly me to think a pet would brighten my life.
End.
Can you find me a pet? Needless to say, the creature has to be a friendly one. You know, the kind that doesn't want to eat you alive as soon as it sees you. Oh I'm so excited! I'm going to clean the house and make some space for the little creature. And I should gather some food. Oh silly me, I don't even know what the creature likes to eat. Here take my husband's special taming traps. He was a proud hunter back in the day. Use it to capture the creature. Hurry back, young man!
I will be back with your pet Roberta.
