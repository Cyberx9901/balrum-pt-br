I'm back with your pet, Roberta!
Oh joy! Show me the creature, boy. 'You show Roberta the creature you captured for her.'
What do you think?
I love it. Thank you so much! Come here little one... well not so little one. What should I call you? Hmm... You look like a Margaret. Roberta and Margaret; doesn't it sound good?
It does, Roberta. Take good care of her.
I will, and thank you. You made a crazy old woman really happy.
Take care, Roberta.
Wait a minute. I have something for you. My husband's old sword. Here take it. You deserve it, young man.
Thank you, Roberta.
