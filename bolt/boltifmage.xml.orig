Guardians of the light.
How do you know those words youngster?
I know them from Arlo. He was a member of your guild a long time ago.
Arlo? I haven't heard from that deserting bastard for ages. He must be hiding somewhere disguised as a peasant while we struggle to keep what's left of the guild together. I bet his easy life made him fat and slow. What do you want from us?
I need to find the remains of the Darkwood necromancers.
Now why would a young man want to find those remains? It's none of my business, right? Fair enough. I cannot help you with that. Only the mages know where Triston hid the remains. I see you are a member of the mages' guild. They should allow you to take a look at their old documents. I wish you good luck.
Thank you.
