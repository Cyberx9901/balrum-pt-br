Why did you kill Ivar? He only wanted to join the guild. I thought the guild need new blood.
You made a big mistake! We should throw you out of the guild for what you have done. That man was a rebel spy! We have our own spies and we know for certain that he was after us.
I'm sorry. I was reckless. It won't happen anymore.
I'm keeping an eye on you boy!
End.
