Guardians of the light.
How do you know those words, youngster?
I know them from Arlo. He was a member of your guild a long time ago.
Arlo? I haven't heard from that deserting bastard for ages. He must be hiding somewhere disguised as a peasant while we struggle to keep what's left of the guild together. I bet his easy life made him fat and slow. What do you want from us?
I want to join your guild.
It's not a good start that you are friend of a traitor. But I suppose you knowing Arlo has nothing to do with your loyalty. Our guild's foundation is trust and honor. If you can prove that you are to be trusted and you are honourable, you will be accepted into our society. I have a task for you. One of our members has been missing for a while. He was exploring the old coal mine north east of here just above the stone quarry. Give me your map I will mark the location. Why he was given this task is confidential. Learn what happened to him and report back.
End.
