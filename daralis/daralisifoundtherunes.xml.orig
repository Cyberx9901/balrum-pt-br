I found the runes.
Excellent! Give them to me.
Here take them.
Thank you, young shadow! Look at these runes. Incredible! I'm going to try to learn as much about these runes as I can. I feel some of them might be really valuable!
Aren't you forgetting something?
What? Oh yes, your teleport rune. Give me a day. It will be ready for you tomorrow! I will go to Knox and start the process as soon as possible. Now please, leave. I need peace when I work.
Thank you.
