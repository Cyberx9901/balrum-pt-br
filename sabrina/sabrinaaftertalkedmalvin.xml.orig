I have heard that you girls are taking trips to the rectory. There's nothing wrong about that, I just want to tell you that father Malvin is angry about it.
Father Malvin is angry? What a joke! More often than not he shows up at our doorstep. What a hypocrite that priest is! He wants all of us for himself? Ha ha!
I just wanted to inform you that he is up to something.
Thank you, but we can protect ourselves. If we lose a few costumers here, we will find new ones there.
End.
