Do you know anything about Zelma?
A good choice, young man, but she is unavailable at the moment.
I'm not here for... Never mind, I'm trying to find her because she disappeared a few weeks ago.
So that's why she didn't came to work lately. I thought she'd found a rich man for herself.
That might be the case. Can you tell me who she worked for?
We don't keep a log, my dear. I'm almost certain that she got into some trouble outside of the brothel. You won't find answers here.
Thank you.
