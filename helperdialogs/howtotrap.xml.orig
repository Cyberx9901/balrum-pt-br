Can you tell me how to use traps?
Why do you need traps boy? Anyway listen carefully.

Seting up a trap is easy. You simply grab your trap and place it on the ground, easy right? Disarming a trap is another thing. Sometimes even I fail to disarm a trap so you should only try to disarm one when there is a really good reason to do so!
Thank you.
