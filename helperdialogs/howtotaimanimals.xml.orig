Tell me how to tame animals.
Again boy? Fine, but pay close attention this time!
Thank you! I will!
First things first. You have to have a few Taming traps on you. Without those special traps you have no chance at taming a wild animal. Then you have to place the trap on the ground and lure the animal into it. It's quite simple really. When your prey is trapped it will struggle and after a while it will look at you as its new pack leader. Of course this might not happen at all. Then you have to start over. The taming potion is really powerful but sometimes it's not enough.
...
Now don't go trying to tame golems boy! Do not face prey that are much powerful than yourself. You won't be able to tame them! Don't overestimate your skills!
I won't. Thank you.
