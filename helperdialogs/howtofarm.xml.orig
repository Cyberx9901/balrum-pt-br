Can you tell me about farming again?
Of course my dear. Let's start.
Please continue.
Everything starts with the field. Without a clean field your plants will have to fight other weeds for nutrition! Once you have a nice field you have to place seeds into it.

Now you have to make sure that your crops have adequate conditions to grow. This means proper fertilization and hydration.
Thank you.
