Anything else I can help you with Osric?
Those pesky chickens again. A few of them managed to get out of the pen. Can you find them and bring them back to me? They sometimes hide in the bushes.
I don't have time for running around chasing chickens.
Alright Osric. I will find them.
Well then why are you asking me?
End.
