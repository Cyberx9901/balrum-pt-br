Do you know anything about stone tablets, Osric?
I have no idea what in the name of the Gods are you talking about, Son.
Thurza found a stone tablet at the Packs' house.
I have found a stone tablet at the Packs' house.
Well I have no clue what that might be. Brown might know something. After all, he's a famous alchemist. The other day, when one of my pigs got sick he made me a special potion that cured my little piggy. If he doesn't know about that thing, than no one will.
Alright, Osric.
