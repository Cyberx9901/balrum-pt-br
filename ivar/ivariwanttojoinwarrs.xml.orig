How are things?
Let's keep our voices down. Are you the one who knows about the warrior's guild?
How do you know about that?
Warriors' guild? They disbanded a long time ago right?
I made a mistake. You are not the one I'm looking for. Excuse me.
End.
I see a lot of things, you know. I keep my eyes wide open.
Yes, I talked to them. Why do you ask?
I want to join them. Can you introduce me to them? I think if someone who knows them introduces me I have a better chance of being accepted.
Sure thing. Follow me.
