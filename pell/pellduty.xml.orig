What are you doing here?
My name is Pell. I'm on guard duty.
It must be quite boring.
It is the most boring thing ever. Nothing will come this way. The king's warriors have disbanded and the other kingdoms are far away over the seas. Who would attack the city? No one, I tell you. Still, I have to stay out here and stare at the trees.
That's a guard's life.
Such a great life.
End.
