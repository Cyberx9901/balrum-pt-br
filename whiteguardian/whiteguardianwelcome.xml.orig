I'm here for the remains of a Darkwood necromancer.
Why does the king seek the remains?
I'm not the king. I have to find all four necromancers. If I fail my people will die.
Your ancestors spoke of those remains your majesty. Triston left me with a mission. I should only allow his descendants to enter the secret chambers of this crypt. I ask you now. Do you need to delve into the secret chambers?
I have to. My people need me.
You will be a good king. Care for your people and your kingdom will rise. The passage is open. You may enter the chambers. Your time is approaching rapidly, my king.
I'll be on my way.
One more thing, your majesty. I cannot allow you to disturb the royal tombs. If you desecrate your ancestors it won't matter that you have the blood of kings running through your veins.
 I understand, dragon.
