I found the remains.
Your mission is far from complete.
Can you help me in finding the remaining necromancers?
I cannot help you, your majesty. You must seek out the help of the guilds. I advise you to contact the mages guild or the warriors guild. The third guild cannot be trusted.
My ancestors could not destroy these remains. Is there a way to destroy them?
Triston tried everything. He gathered the mages and the ancient beings of the world. Not even their united power could destroy the remains. Nasrus protects them with every power she has.
What would happen if I was able to destroy them?
That cannot be foreseen.
I have to try to destroy the remains. It's the only way. If I resurrect the necromancers they would destroy Balrum. There's no force that could stop them.
They must have thought about this. They know that it is nearly impossible to destroy their remains. They wouldn't have sent you on this mission otherwise.
There must be a way.
The mages had an idea when Triston showed them the remains. They thought that if Triston unites the dragons their power might be enough, but Triston was unable to gather the dragons. I was the only one at Triston's disposal and my powers alone were not enough.
How many dragons are there? Why did Triston fail?
There are three of us left. I know that I'm the only one left on this island. Both my brothers left Balrum centuries ago. Time made Triston fail. He and the mages were too anxious. They wanted to get rid of the remains as soon as possible.
Could you contact your brothers? Have you any idea where they might be?
It doesn't work that way. I cannot reach my brothers. I would have helped Triston in finding them but I couldn't. And I cannot help you either.
If I find your brothers will you help me destroy the remains?
I will do whatever I can, my king.
Thank you, guardian.
