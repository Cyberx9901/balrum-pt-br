What is this place?
Who let you in? Are you friend or foe? Speak quickly!
I'm neither, but I can tell you I'm not with the rebels.
Telling me you are not with the rebels means you probably are with the rebels.
How can I prove myself?
You see what's happening down here. Rich men come here and gamble. This is the only fun they can have that the rebels don't know about. Throw in a decent amount of money for them. You look like a fellow who can spare some. Then I will believe your story.
How much?
A thousand thalers will do.
I have to think about this.
