Here is your wine.
You're a good lad. I'm sorry I grunted at you.
You must be a fighter, right?
I was an arena fighter. Those were the days I tell you. No one could beat me. No one! But those days are long forgotten. There is nothing to do now. Even when I was a young mercenary with not much experience life was more exciting.
...
I was a champion! 'People in the inn shout: we know, we know.' The most fun I get now is when I teach the youngsters a few moves. If you are interested in the art of melee combat feel free to talk to me.
...
I cannot go on like this. I'm slowly turning mad. I have to do something with my life.
End.
