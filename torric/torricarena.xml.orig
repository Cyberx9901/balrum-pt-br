I've found something for you!
Speak boy! What?
Go to the old arena. There is a magical lever on the floor. If you pull that lever a copy of you appears and fights you.
I can fight myself? Of course! The most worthy opponent is me. Thank you boy! You might have saved the life of an old fighter!
End.
