I'm looking for work.
You've come to the right place. If the guard let you in, then you must be a capable and trustworthy man. I need someone who I can trust.
You can trust me.
Not so fast, young one. Only Adacus knows if you are to be trusted or not. You have to prove yourself. Only then can I trust you.
What do I need to do to earn your trust?
Do you know where the great graveyard is where King Triston and his soldiers buried all the bodies of the people who lived in Darkwood?
Yes, of course. Everyone knows where that graveyard is and everyone avoids that place.
If you want to earn my trust you have to go to the graveyard and find a way into the sealed grave and bring me whatever you find in there. You have to know that I'm trying to gather all the information I can on Darkwood's history. We are living here so we should at least know what happened in Darkwood. History's always interested me.
I'll find a way into that grave.
Good. Now off you go and be careful.
End.
