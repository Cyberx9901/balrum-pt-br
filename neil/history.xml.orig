I found a letter in the grave but I don't understand the markings on it.
Fascinating. Thankfully I can read the letter. It's written in an ancient language used by the people who lived in these woods. A few of their old houses can still be seen deep in the woods.
What does it say?
It says 'May you never rest in peace'.
There was a skull impaled on a stick.
Those who buried the body wanted to desecrate the person. They sealed the body so no one would know where the body was buried and they even desecrated the body itself. This man or woman must have played an important role in Darkwood's history. 
Do you trust me now?
Yes, I do. The question is whether you want to work for me? It won't be easy.
What do I have to do?
Now that I can trust you I can reveal what I'd found out already. I found a document written in the same ancient language as the one you just gave me. It describes the horrible things the necromancers did within these woods. I believe there are more of these documents to be found! Your task is to find all of the documents so we can understand what was happening in Darkwood centuries ago. 
Where should I start looking?
I don't have specific locations for you. The crypts are a good place to start, but I would imagine that you will be able to find documents all around Darkwood.
If I find something I will bring it to you! 
Very good. We will discover what happened here together!
End.
