I have found a guitar.
Zayin takes a look at the old guitar I found. Slowly a huge smile appears on his face. You found it! You found my fathers guitar!
The guitar belonged to your father?
He was a superb musician. This was his first guitar. Secretly I was hoping you will find it and here it is. Thank you. Thank you very much young traveller. Where did you find it?
It was laying on the ground in an abandoned house in the middle of Erdal.
It must have been our old home. I had to flee Erdal because of the rebels. They killed my father when I was little. I cannot give you much but here, take this. I hope it will aid you in your travels.
Thank you Zayin.
