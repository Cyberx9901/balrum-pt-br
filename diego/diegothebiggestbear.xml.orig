I have heard that you found a giant brown bear.
Greetings, little one. Indeed, I have found the largest bear in history. I'm going to win the hunters' challenge, I'm sure of it. I won the last challenge and if I win this too that would be a new record.
Where is the bear's lair?
Ha! Nice try! Did Jilian send you? Tell her that I would never let her know where that bear is.
I'm only curious.
Well don't be. That bear is mine. Now, if you excuse me I need to prepare for the mighty beast.
End.
