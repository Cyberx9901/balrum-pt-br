What happened here?
Why are you here? Are you a friend of Moulton?
Yes.
No, I'm only a customer. I'm here for some wheat.
Well you are late, boy. The old man is dead. Now I have to look after this stinking farm.
Dead? What happened?
The old man tried to poison us. I have to say it was mighty clever and brave of him but he wasn't so brave when we had a little chat with him. Ha ha!
End.
