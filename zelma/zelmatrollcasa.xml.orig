Are you Zelma?
Yes. Who is asking?
Tina is worried sick. She thinks something horrible happened to you. What are you doing here?
We live here now. We found the perfect man for ourselves.
The perfect man? 'A huge troll comes out of the woods. He waves at the girls and starts to nibble on a huge deer leg.'
Yes, he is perfect. His name is Bugg. He keeps us girls satisfied in every way. We have everything here. I'm never going to go back to work for Sabrina. Tell Tina that everything is fine and she should mind her own business.
End.
