We found a stone tablet at the Packs house. Can you try to translate it, Leonard?
I might be able to translate it, boy. Give it here.
Here it is.
Hmm, this is a really interesting stone. I feel the presence of a dark power in it. I felt it as soon as you entered the house. Somehow this stone tablet is familiar, but I can't remember why.
How long will it take you to translate it?
I don't know my boy. Do me a favor. While I'm working on the tablet fetch me a few mushrooms from Barnabas, will you? He forgot to bring me what I ordered from him. He always forgets to bring me my mushrooms, but he never forgets about the payments.
Grandpa buys ingredients from him too, and yes, he usually forgets to show up with them.
He's a very intelligent man, but he can forget simple things very easily.
Alright Leonard, I'll bring you the mushrooms from Barnabas.
Be quick about it, boy!
End.
