Have you heard about the disappearance and the fires Leonard?
Fires? No I haven't. I sensed a great deal of darkness. It might have been the fires that you talk about. Disappearance? Tell me everything boy.
Our home and the Packs' house caught fire. The Pack family disappeared without a trace and their house burnt down. Grandpa stopped the fire in time.
The Pack family vanished? I have a feeling that dark magic is at work here. Stay away from this, boy. For your own good.
Arlo organized a search for the Packs. If they need me, I will help.
You might be right Leonard.
