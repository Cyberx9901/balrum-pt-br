Here are the mushrooms that Barnabas owed you.
Perfect. Next time that old man has to be more precise.
What about the stone tablet? Have you translated it yet?
Yes, my boy, I have.
And? What does it say?
Boy, the village is great danger.
What? What's the problem?
This is what the carvings mean. 'Audie, Puck, Frieda. In life and death you will serve us forever.'
Who would write such a thing? What can this mean?
Now I remember. I saw a familiar stone tablet at the necromancer's tower. If the necromancers are not dead, then Darkwood is a dangerous place to live in. When I was exploring the tower I was only able to get to the second floor. I felt a dark presence but I attributed it to the ghosts that haunt the corridors. I don't know, but something might be in that tower that we don't know about. Many have tried to explore the tower but none have ever come back. This is why Arlo prohibited anyone from entering the tower. I guard the key to the tower.
Now I understand why Grandpa told me not to go near the tower. We need to tell everyone about this!
No, boy! Don't tell anyone yet. If panic breaks out people might leave the woods and until we know for certain what's happening the woods are a safer place than the outside world.
But the Packs are probably already dead!
I fear that too, my boy. We need to prevent anything like that from happening again. The outside world is a dangerous place to be for women and children. Even for a strong man like you.
I understand. How could have this happened? And why now?
I don't know. We might know more if you fully explore the tower.
I will do what I can.
This is not an easy task. You will need to use everything that you have learned from me and the other masters. Here, take these potions.
Thank you, Leonard.
Here is the key to the tower. You will need to figure out how to get to the top of the tower by yourself. The second floor is a large maze. I barely found my way out of it. I don't know what awaits you beyond the second floor. 
Wish me luck, Leonard.
Be extremely careful, my Son. The village's fate might be in your hands. I will go through all of my books. Maybe I will find something that will help us.
End.
