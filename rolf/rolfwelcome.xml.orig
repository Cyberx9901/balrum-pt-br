You have a lot of paintings here.
Welcome, young man! You wouldn't believe how happy I am to see you here. If I might ask, do you have a troll's carcass?
A troll's carcass? Why would you need one? What would you do with one?
I would paint it of course! Take a look around. I'm fascinated by trolls. You know, not every one of them is dumb and aggressive. There are loving and intelligent trolls out there. When I was young I used to sneak up on trolls and paint them. One day when I was painting a sleeping troll it woke up and beat me nearly to death. I'm not taking any more chances.
So now you only paint dead trolls?
I draw inspiration from them. If you find a dead troll please bring its body to my cabin. I will reward you with one of my paintings!
I will keep an eye out.
