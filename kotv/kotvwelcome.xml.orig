Your brother sent me. I need your help.
Ahh. Your smell is particular. You're no ordinary mortal. You are a specimen of the royal bloodline.
Yes, I am. Both of your brothers agreed to help me. I need to destroy the remains of the Darkwood Necromancers. Otherwise many innocent people will die.
Why do you need my help?
Only the power of the dragons can destroy the remains.
I cannot simply enter your world, mortal. I will need a small sacrifice from you.
I will do anything to help my people.
I need a part of your mortality. What can you offer me?
I offer you my vitality.
Ahh yes. Sweet mortality. I will help you now, mortal. Tell me, where are my brothers?
They are underground in the Royal Crypts near Erdal. Thank you, dragon. Please take us to your brothers. We need to hurry.
Prepare yourself, royal mortal.
End.
