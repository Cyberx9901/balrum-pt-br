Hey Dudley. I'm ready to explore the ruins that we found.
Ah I'm sorry, I cannot go with you. I have to help around the house and it's time to harvest our fields.
Excuses again. All right, I'll go by myself. But if I find something interesting, you'll be sorry.
I doubt that you'll find anything worth mentioning. There are lots of old crypts around here, why would this one be so special? You know what happened last time, so be careful. There might be larvae down there.
End.
