Do you know anything about the disappearance and the fires, Jones?
Only what you already know boy. Aron might not be as good a blacksmith as he thinks he is. I always said that Edwig from the other village is a much better master than Aron. My torches are from Edwig and I have no reason to complain about them. I didn't know the Packs very well. The only thing I know about them is that they're decent folk. A shame that bad things always seem to happen to good people.
End.
