I'm looking for work, Jones. Do you need help with anything?
I need to prepare wood for the winter. I wanted to mark some trees I would like to chop down today. If you're really looking for work, look no further! Chopping down trees and then bringing them home is real hard work. It'll make you strong, if nothing else. I can give you a few thalers if you bring me ten pieces of pine.
Where can I find pine trees?
You'll find a bunch south from here. You won't miss them.
I'll bring you the wood Jones.
Thank you. Make sure to bring plenty of water with you. Hard work will dry your body out fast. And it might be a good idea to pack some food too.
End.
