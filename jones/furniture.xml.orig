Our home almost burnt down. Grandpa is fine, but I need to repair the damage to the house. I'll need to create a small cupboard because the one we had burnt to ashes.
How could that happen? Two houses in the village caught fire on the same day. Your old man is a tough one. He can handle a little fire. You know how to build a cupboard. I've already taught you. You can buy wood from me, but we live in a forest so you can chop down a few trees and that's free. Please don't tell Selina I told you to chop down trees instead of buying them from me.
Thank you Jones. I won't tell Selina. When can we continue our lessons?
Anytime boy! You are a good student. Next time I'll show you how to build sturdy chairs and tables.
End.
