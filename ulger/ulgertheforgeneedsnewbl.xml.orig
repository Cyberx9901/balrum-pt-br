What are you doing here?
Who are you? What do you want? I'm not what you think I am!
Calm down. What are you talking about?
Thank Adacus. You are not one of them. I come from a distant land. The rebels don't like outsiders. They slaughtered my kind.
I'm sorry to hear that. The rebels are one of the worst things to happen to Balrum. What are you doing here?
As you already know, I'm hiding from the rebels. When I came to Balrum I had high hopes. I wanted to join the famous blacksmiths of Erdal. Their knowledge of the metals and my foreign techniques would have produced some fine armors. Now I can only dream about sculpting the glowing metal.
End.
