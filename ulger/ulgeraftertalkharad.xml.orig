There is an apprentice blacksmith in the city. His name is Harad. He watches over the old smithy day and night, even though he doesn't work as a smith. He is a dedicated fellow. You two should work together. You could teach him.
That would be wonderful, but I cannot go to the city. The rebels would kill me.
What if Harad and the smith came to you?
What are you talking about?
I could build the smithy for you here in this cave and I am certain that Harad would be more than willing to come here and work with you.
You would do that? We could make all kinds of things. This cave is full of precious metals. If you do this for me I will make you a fine armor. I cannot believe it. A smithy here in the cave. What a great idea.
I will start building the facilities and I will talk to Harad as soon as possible.
Thank you, stranger. You've given a new meaning to my life. I can never repay you.
End.
