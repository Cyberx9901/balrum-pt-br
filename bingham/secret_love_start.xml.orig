I'm looking for work. Do you need any help?
Thank Adacus! Yes! I need help in a.. personal matter.
What kind of matter?
Do you know Elfreda? The beautiful woman who makes the best soup in the village!
I've met her once. But I can't say I know her more deeply.
Oh she is a wonderful human being. You are missing out. You should get to know her better. Now, back to my problem. I've been in love with her since the day I first laid eyes on her. Needless to say, I'm really shy when it comes women. I want her to know how I feel. Could you be my messenger? 
Of course! What is your message?
Tell her that I think she is the most beautiful being in the whole of Balrum! Can you tell her that? Would you do that for me? Is it a bad idea?
You need to start somehow. I'll give her your message, Bingham. Isn't she a little old for you?
Old? Nonsense! Thank you for doing this! I'm so excited!
End.
