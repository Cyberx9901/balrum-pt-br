I want to join your guild. I have to earn the trust of a few of you to be able to join. Do you need any help?
So you want to join? Good! We need more men! But we need strong men. Are you up for the challenge?
I think so.
You think so? Words are not enough. Fight me! If you win I will tell Bolt that you should join our guild!
Fine. I will fight you. When and where?
Right here, right now! We can only use physical attacks against each other. No magic is allowed! If you use magic I will automatically win. You can challenge me anytime and as many times as you want. I'm sure you won't be able to defeat me in our first fight. Ha ha! I'm ready when you are! Oh and also, you cannot use your pet!
End.
