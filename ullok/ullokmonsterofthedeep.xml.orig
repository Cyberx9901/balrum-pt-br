I'm looking for work. Do you need any help?
You look like a capable fellow! Listen here. There is a monster around these waters. And we fisherman are finding it more and more difficult to fish as the days go by. We often see the creature. It's large and green with a monstrous mouth filled with teeth. I have never seen a beast like it before, I tell you. Can you help us? Will you slay the beast?
What's in it for me?
The rebels take away most of our fish. So I don't have money, if that's what you are after. You might be interested in something else?
I'm listening.
One day, just when I was about to pack up my fishing gear something got hooked on my fishing rod. As I pulled it out from the water I saw to my amazement it was a ring. It was a heavy ring. Really odd. I hurried home and showed it to my wife. I wanted to give it to her but she kept saying that there must be a reason why it was in the water and she does not even want to touch it. I could give it to you.
Interesting. I will slay this beast of yours.
Be prepared traveler. That beast is huge!
End.
