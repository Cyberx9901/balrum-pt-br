I've found Murray!
Very good! Where was the blasted thing? Ahh, it doesn't matter. Murray! Fetch my crystal bottles, quickly! Look at him. Good for nothing. I really need to perfect my methods. If only I could talk to the Architect. He could answer so many of my questions.
Who is this Architect?
It was his idea to build the underground city thousands of years ago. He controlled dozens of giant stone golems to aid him with the digging and building. Legends say that he was a great necromancer. He somehow managed to be the king's consultant. I think he only designed the underground city for his own reasons. A truly great necromancer he was. Now! I don't have time to talk about legends. Here, take this, it's yours. Now leave.
