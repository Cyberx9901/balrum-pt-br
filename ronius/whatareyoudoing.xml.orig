What is this place?
You are lucky, young traveller.
Why?
Usually I don't bother with visitors. They end up in my pit rather quickly. But I need your help. You can thank Murray that you are still alive.
I know your type. You are a necromancer. Say goodbye to your pit.
So you kill everyone you see?
I might have exaggerated a little. Will you help me or not?
Who is Murray? And yes, I will help you. I don't want to end up in your lovely pit.
Good! Good! Murray is my masterpiece. He was an unfortunate peasant who wondered too close to these lands. The undead here swiftly took care of him. I thought he would make a great servant so I tried to resurrect him. He did come back from the dead but he has his problems to say the least. Ever since I've been trying to perfect my methods. He went missing a few weeks ago. If you find him bring him back to me and I will reward you greatly.
If I see him I will bring him back.
Excellent! Now leave. I have more important things to do than talking to you.
End.
