Can I talk to you, father?
Sure, son. What bothers your soul?
Father Malvin knows about the girls you have been bringing to the rectory.
I have to confess, father. I have been to the brothel more than once and I have been hearing rumors of newborn children. One might be mine? What should I do, father?
'The man's eyes are open wide and they remain without blinking for many seconds'. If one finds himself in a situation like this one, one should do the honorable thing and bring up the child.
Thank you, father. I will do what I have to.
The father knows? What have we done? Our animal needs took over our minds. Tell the father that we will end it once and for all.
I will.
