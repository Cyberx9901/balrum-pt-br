Why are there corpses in your back room? Explain yourself!
How, how do you know?
I found your potion. Why are you hiding corpses? Tell me, or I will tell the others right now.
Calm down. I know how this looks, but I'm not a murderer nor insane. I'm studying the bodies of the deceased. I'm a healer but not a traditional one. I'm healing without spells. I have been researching this new type of healing for a long time because there are fewer healers in Balrum day after day. People in this village won't understand that is why I have to hide my research.
I don't believe you! People have to know what you are doing with their loved ones.
What is this new way of healing?
Instead of magic I heal with my hands and special medicine. If something needs to be cut out, I cut it out. If something tears, I patch it up.
That sounds barbaric but somehow I believe you. Can I have some of your special medicine?
Yes you can, but please don't reveal my research. I knew that the smell will be a problem.
I won't. When you are done with the bodies please give them the respect they deserve.
