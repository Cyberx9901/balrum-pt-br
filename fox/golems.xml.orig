I heard you have defeated a golem once Fox!
I once was ordered to hunt down a golem. The golem wandered too close to a village and started killing people who got in its way. There was nothing special about the hunt except one thing.
What was the special thing?
I was not able to harm the creature. None of my weapons could harm it.
Then how did you defeat it?
At the time I was an apprentice of a great hunter. He told me that a long time ago a young blacksmith figured out how to wound these creatures. Your weapon needs to have certain crystals forged into it. It's a really quite simple procedure. I have a feeling that you are after those stone golems which roam these woods. It would be irresponsible of me to not give you a weapon since I know once you get something in your head.. Here take this, but be really careful. It's a really old weapon, it isn't worth much.
You are correct Fox, as always. Thank you for the weapon.
