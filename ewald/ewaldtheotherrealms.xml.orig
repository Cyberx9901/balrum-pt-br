Greetings!
You look just like me when I was young. Your eyes are full of expectation. You are an adventurer, right?
We can say that, yes. Who are you?
My name is Ewald. I come from a faraway land. I must say I made a big mistake by traveling here. Little did I know there is such misery here. I was intrigued by the tales of Balrum my parents told me. There might have been a mighty kingdom here some time, but now there sure isn't.
Where did you come from?
I cannot tell you that. Especially now that I have seen what happened here. It might be cruel but my lands cannot take more lost souls. We have our own troubles, you know.
Can you tell me about the other realms?
I don't know much about them. There are four realms that have been discovered. Each separated by months of sea. And let me tell you it's not just water. The sea is a living creature itself. We barely made it alive. One realm is an unforgiving desert, the other one is nothing but ice. Balrum and my lands are the only ones that are made for our kind.
Thank you Ewald. I'll be on my way.
Keep your eyes open, young traveler.
End.
