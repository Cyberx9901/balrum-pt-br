Are you the owner of this large farm?
Yes, I am. What brings you here, young man?
I'm looking for work.
Well you've come to the right place boy! I have some work for you. Lately my pigs are not in the mood, if you understand what I'm saying. If this goes on there won't be enough meat for the people. I think the only way is to introduce pigs from another farm.
You need me to bring new pigs to your farm?
Exactly! If you bring me ten pigs I will pay you handsomely.
I'll see what I can do.
You would do a great deal for the city. I hope you will succeed.
End.
