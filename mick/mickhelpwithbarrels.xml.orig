You have a lot of barrels.
And so I should. I'm a cooper.
I'm looking for work. Do you need any help?
My helper, Travis, is nowhere to be found. I'm not as young and strong as I used to be and he was the one who brought the raw wood to my shop. I don't really care about him. He was a lousy helper and quite a drunkard for his age, but if you see him could you tell him that I'm waiting for him and his help is needed here. Until then, can you bring me some raw wood and some bark?
Why do you need bark?
It's my secret ingredient. It makes the spirit taste like honey and gives it a sweet finish. I char the bark and place it inside my casks. Not only does it give the spirit its exquisite taste but it also gives it a beautiful color.
Who do you supply with your casks and how much wood do you need?
There is only a single distiller left in Erdal. A long time ago there were several but the rebels demanded too much from them and they fled the realm. Now old Ivo has to satisfy the rebels' thirst on his own. I will need a lot! Forty logs will do. If you do this for me I'll tell Ivo that you were good help. He might let you in the circle. You will know what I mean.
I'm going to help you, old man. I'll bring the wood you need.
I don't have the time to help you right now.
Than why are you wasting my and your own time?
End.
Thank you, young man.
End.
