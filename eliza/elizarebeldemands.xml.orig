How are things?
Well young man, things are not good.
What's the problem?
The rebels. Their demands are outrageous. They need more and more wheat. Moulton and I cannot keep up.
How can I help?
I don't think you can help, darling. The only way we could keep up is if we somehow managed to grow the crops faster.
There might be a way. Have you heard about forest wisps? When these wisps are near plants the plants grow faster and stay healthy.
Well I'll be damned. Forest wisps on my farm? Are these creatures peaceful? What if they attack me or one of my workers?
If you don't anger them they won't be any trouble. What do you say? Should I bring one to your farm?
You have a certain aura around you. I trust you, boy! Yes let's try this!
I'll be back with a wisp.
