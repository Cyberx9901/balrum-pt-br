You have a nice home here, Clay.
Do I know you? Who are you?
I'm an orphan, just like you. My grandfather took me in when I was little.
I didn't know there was another orphan in the woods.
I learned that Father Hain raised you. Why did you leave him?
It's none of your business.
I'm sorry, you are right. I somehow felt connected to you because we are both orphans.
No, I'm sorry. I have a problem with my temper. At least that's what Father Hain told me. I left him because when I was little he beat me every day. The smallest thing made him angry. If I did something wrong he would beat me until I stopped crying. I hate him. 
That's horrible.
And that's not everything. He made me do everything around the church, even when I was small and weak. My childhood was horrible. He never let me play with the other kids. In his eyes I was nothing but one of his servants. He even told the people that I'm good for nothing. This is why I left him as soon as I could.
How could he do that? I think you need to know that you are not really an orphan.
I should be going now. Thank you for telling me and I'm sorry you had to endure all that.
What are you talking about?
Your father is alive, and your uncle too.
You are lying. My parents are dead.
It's true. I met your uncle. His name is Spike, but I don't know where your father is. 
You are telling me that my father is alive? 
Yes!
Get out of here. Now!
I'm sorry..!
Leave now!
End.
