You look frightened. Is everything alright?
I told the others about the ghost, but they don't believe me.
What ghost?
A woman. I saw her late at night in the woods to the east of here. She kept walking towards me. I didn't know what to do. I had to run. As I got further away from her she whispered something into my ear as if she was standing next to me.
What did she say?
I was so frightened I didn't understand, but it had to do something with her child.
I believe you.
The others don't. They think I was drunk to the bone.
End.
