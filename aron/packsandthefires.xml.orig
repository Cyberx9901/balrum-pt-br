Arlo says that the torches you made started the fires.
Nonsense. My torches are of the highest quality. Arlo is mad if he thinks my torches caused the fires. Not even a single torch I made was brought back to me for repairs. Do you really think two torches fail on the same day? And why did the family disappear? It makes no sense.
I know you are a great master. At our house the fire started far away from the torch on the wall. The wall that holds the torch wasn't burnt at all. I have no idea how the family disappeared. It can't be because of a torch.
There you have it. I knew my torches are fine. Arlo can stop blaming me for the fires. He should focus his energy on finding the Packs.
End.
