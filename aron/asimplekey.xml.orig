I found an old locked door with a keyhole shaped like a triangle. Can you make a key for it?
I sure can kid, but why do you need to open that door? It was closed for a reason. You might get into trouble.
It's going to be fine. Most likely it's just an old empty crypt.
All the more reason not to go in there! But if you want it I can make it for you. How big was the triangle exactly?
It was half the length of my thumb. Thank you for making it, Aron.
Here you go. Don't even ask, it wasn't any trouble work for me, so you don't owe me anything.
Thanks.
