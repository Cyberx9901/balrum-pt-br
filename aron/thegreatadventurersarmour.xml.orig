An adventurer named Fleming gave me his famous armour for repairs.
Show me the work, boy.. Ah, a fine piece of metal this is. It's design tells me it was made centuries ago. A true heavy armour. Only the strongest warriors can bear its weight. It's in a horrid condition, I might add. There are large spots of rust on the greaves and the left vambrace.
Vambrace?
The vambrace is the piece of armour that protects your forearm, boy. This armour requires regular cleaning and attention. The current owner doesn't know that.
Can you repair it, Aron? Fleming is a poor man. He was hoping that you might do the work for free.
Can you repair it? Fleming gave me a few dozen thalers for your work.
I told Fleming that you might do the work for free because nowadays you can't work on armour and weapons, so his famous armour might be a treat for you.
Your friend is out of luck. I can't do the work for nothing. Take this fine armour to someone else and tell this Fleming that he should not expect free work from strangers.
End.
Yes, my boy. This armour is really interesting. But I have to replenish my supply of iron ore, because I'm running low. Bring me 10 lumps of iron and I'll repair Flaming's armour. Keep the thalers boy.
Thank you Aron! I'll bring you the ore you need. When will you be ready?
Dear boy, you shouldn't have told him that I would do the work for free. The repairs will take a lot of time. But if you could do my work while I'm repairing it we might have a deal! I'm running out of iron ore. Bring me 10 lumps of iron and I'll repair this fine armour. I'll start the work right now.
I'll bring you the ore you need. When will you be ready?
The repairs shouldn't take more than a day. If you bring me the ores I will need at least a day to repair this armour for you.
End.
