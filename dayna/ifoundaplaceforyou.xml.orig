I found a place for you!
What are you talking about?
I found a cave full of deer. There were trees underground! It was beautiful! I felt safe there. I think you should visit that place.
Interesting. Tell me where that place is. 'You show Dayna where you found the cave on your map.' I will go there. Thank you for telling me!
End.
