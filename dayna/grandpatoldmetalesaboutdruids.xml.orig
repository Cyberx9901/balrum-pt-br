I figured it out! Grandpa told me tales about druids who could speak to animals. You are a druid!
You can call me that. But please don't tell anyone. Let's keep this our secret.
So, can you talk to animals?
Yes. Or to be more precise I was able to talk to them.
What happened?
This place happened. Each day this place weakens my abilities. A few years ago I could talk to any creature and that way I could help them. But now I don't understand them and they don't understand me. Darkwood is evil. These woods resonate life energy and death at the same time. Today all my powers are gone.
I'm sad to hear that. Is there any way I can help you regain your powers?
It's very kind of you, but the only way is if I leave this place, and you know that none of us can. 
Yes, I know.
