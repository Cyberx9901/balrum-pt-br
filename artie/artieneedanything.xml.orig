Do you need anything?
Well, young man, thank you for asking. If you don't mind it would be great if you could fetch a few bottles of medicine from Ivo for me. His bottles ease my pain.
You are in pain?
Don't worry, boy. I've lived all my life in pain. My legs, you know. They were the reason why I couldn't become a knight. I guess it could have been worse. You just have to look around you and see that no matter how bad things look, there is always someone who has a worse life than you.
I guess you are right. How many do you need?
Four will do, my boy. Here, take this money. It should be enough for old Ivo. Keep every coin he gives you back. Tell him they are for me. He only gives the good stuff to a few people. The rebels drink some watered down cheap stuff. He he...
End.
