How are things?
These golems. They make our life a misery.
Why?
Their numbers are increasing every day. My men have been trying to fight them but we might have to close the mine because the situation is becoming impossible. They are coming from every direction. I fear we have found their underground cave and angered them. I don't know what to do.
You should ask for help.
Many years ago the mages helped us with the golems. One of them needed their essence. The mage who was experimenting with the golems used powerful spells against the beasts. At least this is what I have been told.
They needed their essence?
Really powerful golems all have stone essences inside them. The mage was trying to control them somehow.
How did you fight the golems when the mages were not there to help?
My father told me tales about a group of miners whose job was to defeat such beasts. They are only a legend now.
Where can I find a really powerful golem?
Don't be reckless boy! Those creatures are dangerous! You can search the mines here, but if you try to find one you are putting yourself in great danger. Here take this sword. You don't stand a chance against them without it.
Thank you.
