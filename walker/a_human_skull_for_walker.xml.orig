I found you a human skull.
You have indeed. I'm proud of you. But I need one last thing from you before I'll teach you.
Just tell me what do I need to do.
Don't be rude, or I might change my mind. Find me the cape of a warlock. It can be in bad condition, it does not matter.
Where should I start looking? 
There are crypts all around this area. Necromancers used this place for hundreds of years, so that is no surprise. They need to honour their dead, too. I think your best chance is in one of those crypts.
End.
