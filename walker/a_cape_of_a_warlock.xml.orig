I found a cape!
Marvelous! 'Walker grabs the cape from your hands.' Thank you for doing the hard work for me. My creation is finally done! Finally! Look now, child! Look what you've done! 'Walker takes a piece of the cape and throws it in a small bottle filled with black liquid and he drinks it.'
End.
