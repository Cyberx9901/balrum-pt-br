You have a fine lab here, sir.
Thank you. I see your not one of those who think that my bottles are full of wine.
I know a little alchemy myself.
Do you? Do you want to learn some more?
Brown is teaching me. I'm still learning.
Brown. He is a fine alchemist, but I'm sure he only teaches you the so-called 'safe' potions. I could teach you real alchemy. Alchemy that can permanent increase your strength or your intelligence. But of course, nothing is for free in this world, you know.
Teach me.
Not so fast. First, you have to do a few tasks for me.
What do I need to do?
Bring me one black blindweed. That will do for now.
End.
