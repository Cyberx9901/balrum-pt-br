Buck is hiding corpses in his house! You have to do something!
What are you talking about? Corpses? In his house?
He is hiding at least half a dozen dead bodies. Something has to be done quickly before he disappears!
Blasphemy! How dare he? I will send for him right now. A cold prison cell will be his home from now on. Adacus will not tolerate such heretic acts.
End.
