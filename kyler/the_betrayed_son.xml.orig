Spike told me you took in his sister's son.
Indeed. We took in the child many years ago. We decided that he should be raised by Father Hain.
What name did father Hain give the child?
He named the child Clay. He is a grown man now. 
Where does Clay live?
For a long time Clay lived with father Hain. But when he was old enough he left the village. He was very eager to leave. I don't know where he is now. Father Hain ought to know. Ask him.
I will. Who is Clay's father?
All I know is that he lives near the swamp.
End.
