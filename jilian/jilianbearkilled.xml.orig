I have slain Diego's bear.
What? Why? Why did you do that? What are we going to do?
I have its fur. You can have it.
Get it out of here. I don't want it.
I thought you wanted to win this time?
There is a thing called honor, you know... but we have to respect the beast. I cannot make a trophy out of it. The others - and especially Diego - would be furious. Hmm. What if we change its fur to black?
What?
If Diego sees the brown bear he will most certainly recognize it. We have to dye it.
That's not really an honorable thing to do.
How can we dye its fur?
Give it to me. I can make its fur black. Thank you for your help. Although I must say, my conscience is telling me that this is not right. On the other hand, we have to honor the great bear. I promised you my knowledge. From now on I will teach you everything I know.
End.
You are right. We cannot do this. Keep the trophy. Now please leave.
End.
