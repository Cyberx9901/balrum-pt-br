I think I've found Diego's brown bear.
Have you? I don't want to know. I'm not a cheat. He found the bear, he should be the one who slays it.
I thought you wanted to win this time?
I understand. I wish you luck with the challenge.
Thank you.
End.
I have honor, you know. Now please leave, I have things to do.
End.
