Are you one of the hunters?
Because I'm a woman, right? You find it hard to believe that a woman can be a hunter?
To be honest, you don't look like someone who can handle a weapon.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. I'm just looking around.
Get out.
End.
Looking around?
I'm looking for work.
Great! You seem alright. You see, every ten years we hunters participate in a grand challenge. Whoever brings the most impressive trophy wins. The others all have something impressive. Diego has found the biggest brown bear in years. I have to outdo him somehow.
If I see or find something, I will tell you.
Thank you, stranger. If you can help me out I will teach you a thing or two about hunting.
End.
