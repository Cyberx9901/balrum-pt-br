Are you a member of the mages' guild?
Welcome traveler. You have completed the puzzles presented to you at the lower levels. This means you have the right to be here. Indeed, I am a member of the mages' guild. What may I help you with?
Leonard, a former member of your guild, sent me here. I need to find the remains of the Darkwood necromancers. Leonard told me your guild knows where they are.
Indeed. Many years ago our guild was given the task of sealing the final resting places of the necromancers' remains with powerful magic.
Can you tell me where they hid the remains?
I'm afraid I cannot. I can sense that you are not an ordinary traveler. Still I cannot make exceptions. The knowledge that you seek is a secret to outsiders. Only members of the guild or members of the warriors' guild may seek out this information. You are not a member of either guild.
My quest is of utmost importance. People's lives are in danger. I need this information.
Please. Lower your voice. I understand, but I cannot help you. You have to be a member of one of the guilds so we know that you are to be trusted.
How can I become a member of the mages' guild?
End.
Continue along these corridors. You will find members of the guild doing their daily tasks. Find a man named Van. He's responsible for the recruits. He will have answers for you.
Thank you.
