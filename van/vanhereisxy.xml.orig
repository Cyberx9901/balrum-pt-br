'Van looks genuinely surprised' I see. Well, you've completed your first task. Good job. From now on you are a novice of the guild. The novice is not even a rank, and being one does not grant you membership. Now you have to earn the trust of three members of the guild. Come back when you have earned their trust.
End.
