Your father sent me. Do you know why the milk you sell is sour?
Sour? Father? I don't know what you are talking about. This milk here is fine.
Alright son. No need to be alarmed. I'm sure it was a mistake. I will leave you to your work.
Listen here, boy. Something is wrong with the milk you sell. Your father looked really upset about this.
I might have forgotten to clean the milk churns a few times.
What should I do with you now? Should I tell your father about this?
Please don't tell father! He would send me back to keep the church clean. That church is huge. I promise I will work harder. I will keep the churns clean!
Keep the churns clean and you won't have to go back to the church. You should start right now before your father comes here.
