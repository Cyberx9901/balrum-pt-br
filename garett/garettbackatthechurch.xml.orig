How are you Garett?
I'm fine. Leave me alone, I have a lot of work to do.
I'm sorry that you had to come back to the church.
It's because of you. You told father.
If you had taken care of the churns this would not have happened.
I guess you are right. Would you do me a favor?
What favor?
There is a girl here in the church. I'm too scared to talk to her. Could you tell her to meet me in front of the church after sundown? I'm going to gather all my courage and I'm going to talk to her! I might need a few beers before. Yes I definitely need a few beers.
What's in it for me, Garett?
I will tell you a secret! I see a lot of things happening in the church you know.
Deal. I will speak to her.
