I told Queenie. She was excited. She will meet you there at sundown.
Thank you so much. 'Hic'
What about that secret Garett?
Oh yes. You must have seen the rusty switches on the wall. I know the combination! It is on, on, off, on, on. Or is it off, off, on, off, off. I don't know for sure. But I know there is something interesting behind those walls. The priests keep going in there.
Thank you Garett.
I'm so nervous. 'Hic' I have to drink another beer.
End.
