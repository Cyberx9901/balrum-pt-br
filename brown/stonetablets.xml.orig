Have you ever heard of stone tablets?
Why are you curious about such things? Stone tablets are long forgotten magical items.
Thurza found a stone tablet at the Packs house.
I've found a stone tablet at the Packs house.
My knowledge of tablets is quite limited. But one thing I do know. They mean trouble. If I were you I would stay away from them. Where is the stone tablet now?
It's at our house. Grandpa is trying to translate the writings on it.
Your grandfather is a wise man, but even at his old age he is an adventurer at heart. I advise you to leave the stone tablet be.
Thank you, Brown. The writings on it might help find the Packs, so we need to translate it.
In that case you might be right, but please be careful.
End.
