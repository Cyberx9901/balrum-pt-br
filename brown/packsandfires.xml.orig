What do you think about the Packs and the fires Brown?
There's not enough information about what happened, boy. I can't say I have an opinion on the matter.
The only certain thing is that the Packs are missing.
I doubt that they will be found. When bad things happen in life there is always a little good too. The good was that your grandfather survived and that you were not home when the tragedy happened.
How can you say that they won't be found? They will find them, I know it.
I feel the same. The Packs are most likely lost forever.
