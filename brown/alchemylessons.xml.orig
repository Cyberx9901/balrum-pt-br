I'm here for my lessons Brown.
Good, good, my dear boy. Now that you know a few recipes by heart, you should try and make some by yourself. Go and find all the ingredients for a Minor Healing Potion. You only need a few grown Life Plants and a Simple Bottle. You can find the plants everywhere in the woods, they are large plants with bulky dark green leaves.
I know, Brown. I will be back with the potions.
Feel free to use my alchemy table. If Sam starts to mumble, simply ignore him. He's been up for more than a hundred days.
I hope I won't make a mess like I did last time.
Practice makes perfect, boy.
End.
