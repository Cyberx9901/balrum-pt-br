There's a woman who's awfully sick. Her eyes are turning yellow. She cannot move. She needs a powerful healing potion!
Her eyes are turning yellow? That is a bad sign. I'm afraid I cannot help her, boy.
There must be something we can do to help her!
Barnabas might know how to deal with this. Quickly go and tell him what you told me!
End.
