Here is your ring Cardew.
My ring! My blue ring! Thank you thank you!
You're welcome, and you were right. Rhys took your ring but he gave it back without hesitation, so don't be mad at him.
My magical ring! Look how sparkly it is! 
What kind of magical powers does your ring have?
I'll tell you, but don't tell anyone else! My ring can take me to a place. A place of peace. I shall put my ring in my casket here so Rhys won't be able to steal it from me again!
All right Cardew.
