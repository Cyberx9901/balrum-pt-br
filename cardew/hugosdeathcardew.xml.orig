What do you know about Hugo's death, Cardew?
Hugo is my best friend.
Yes I know, Cardew, but Hugo is no longer with us. Do you remember how he died?
Hugo died because of the deep well. It was the well that caused him trouble. I hate the well.
What do you mean? The well got him in trouble? Do you mean he died because of something connected to the well?
Leave me. Leave me alone. You are not Hugo.
I'm sorry, Cardew.
