Have you seen or heard anything, Cardew?
I know, I know.
What do you know, Cardew? Speak slowly.
The smoked pork sausage is my favourite. Osric never gives me one. Where did I put the deer leg? Have you seen my juicy deer leg?
No Cardew I have not seen your food. Think Cardew, do you know anything about the disappearance of the Packs?
Packs?
Your neighbours, Pack, Frieda and Audie.
Audie? We play hide and seek sometimes. She might have my deer leg!
Please Cardew, try to focus. They are missing and their house has burnt down. Have you seen anything suspicious?
Do you want to play hide and seek with me? But where is my deer leg? Please tell Audie to bring back my deer leg.
Take care, Cardew.
