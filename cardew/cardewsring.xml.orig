What happened to your ring, Cardew?
Rhys. He stole my ring! He stole my ring! He stole my ring!
Calm down, Cardew. Why do you think Rhys stole your ring?
I told him my ring is valuable. It's blue you know.
And he took it from you?
He stole my ring! He stole my ring! He stole my ring!
I will talk to Rhys about your ring.
