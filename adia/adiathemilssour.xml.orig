I'm looking for work. Do you need any help?
I might have something for you to do.
What do you have for me?
The milk I got from Bardan was sour again. This has been happening for days now. Can you get to the bottom of this? And I demand a refund! He owes me 50 thalers! If you do this, I will give you half of the money. Norsa and Zane also received sour milk. This is outrageous. In these times every thaler counts; the rebels won't allow us to have a fortune. If someone gets a small fortune together the rebels will come and take most of it away. Bardan's farm is just up from here to the north.
I'll see what I can do. Take care.
