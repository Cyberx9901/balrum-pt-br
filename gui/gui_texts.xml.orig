Start Over
I was only a child when we fled the kingdom and took refuge in Darkwood. A lot has happened in the past twenty years while we have been living here. Everyone has a part in the life of the village. We have become a real community. Now that I have grown up it's time for me to decide what part I will play.
People say that the woods protect us from the filthy world that Balrum has become. They forget that the place we live in once was a place of horrors. The dark history of the forest keeps trouble outside. The stories about why we had to hide in the woods each seem different. I don't know who to believe. Every time I ask Grandpa about the past he changes the subject. One thing is for sure. Something horrible happened. Maybe one day I will know the truth.
I know that Grandpa was an apprentice of a wizard when he was younger but he rarely uses magic nowadays. He often tells me that I should practice magic and embrace my supposed abilities, but I'm not sure that I want to. I have been taking lessons in alchemy and the arcane from Brown and Leonard.
In my free time I usually
and often times I practice 
I try and help everywhere I can but I'm more eager to help out
because the work they do interests me. Life was much easier when I was younger. Now my head is filled with questions and doubt.

Combat in Balrum is turn based. To attack an enemy you have to have at least one ability selected in the quickslot bar. To select an ability right click on its icon or press the appropriate number on your keyboard. Selected melee abilities can be used with a left click on the targeted enemy. Selected ranged abilities can be used with a right click on the targeted enemy. To target an enemy simply left click on it and it's health and mana bar will turn silver indicating that it has been targeted. Special combat effects play an important role in the game so always check the effects on you and on your targets. Combat effects affecting you will appear in the top right corner of the screen. Effects affecting your enemies will appear below their health/mana bar.
You have to place an ability icon from your spellbook into one of your quickslots to be able to use it. Some abilities can be used directly from your spellbook. To place an ability into one of your quickslots simply left click on the ability icon and place it into the desired quickslot.
  	
It's raining heavily tonight as we walk back from the hunt with Fox. I have a strange feeling and I can see that Fox is worried too. We separate at the edge of the forest. As I approach our home I smell smoke and can see light shining through the woods. Something bad has happened.
Ok
The loaded game is not entirely compatible with the current game version. If the patch contained map adjustments and you already have been on the affected maps, those changes will be only visible to you once you start a new game.
Health slowly regenerates when fully hydrated or fully fed.

These are your known recipes. Switch between recipe categories by clicking on the arrows at the bottom of this panel. Hovering over a recipe name will inform you about its ingredients and the crafting device it can be made at.
A green cursor indicates that the object beneath it is interactable. When the cursor turns green while hovering on a chest or barrel it indicates that there is something inside that container.
Over the years I became familiar with the wildlife. Frogs, rats and some of the large larvae are not aggressive but every other animal will try to eat me. Brown told me to pick up every plant I see so I can experiment with them at the alchemy table. There are a number of berry bushes growing here. Some of the berries have powerful medicinal effects.
Can be created by Combining.
