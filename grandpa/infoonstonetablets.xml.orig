I've talked to Brown about the stone tablets.
What did he say? Does he know something?
The only thing that he told me is that we should stay away from the tablet and that they are long forgotten magical items.
Good old Brown was always a little scared of the unknown. Right now we can't ignore this. It might help us in finding the Packs.
That's what I told him. He agreed, but said that we should be really careful. Why does Brown think that the tablet is dangerous?
I don't know, Son. Brown was always afraid of things that are new to him. He only trusts things that are written about in his books. Only time will tell if the stone tablet is dangerous or not.
Brown is a good man and a great teacher. Let him be a little bit too cautious.
