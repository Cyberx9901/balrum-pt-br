I need your help Grandpa!
Calm down Son. What can I help you with?
Thurza found a stone tablet in the debris at the Packs house.
I have found a stone tablet at the Packs house.
A stone tablet? Put it on the table, Son!
I never seen anything like it. What can it be? Can you read the writing on it?
Interesting, it looks like the fire didn't damage the stone tablet at all. As if someone had put it in the debris on purpose after the fire. It is an ancient stone tablet but the writing on it is fresh. Who, or what, made this? I might be able to read the text but I will need time. And how did it end up in the Packs' house?
I don't know. I hope you can read it, Grandpa. It might help us in finding the Packs.
Give me some time boy. Go to Brown, it is time for your alchemy lessons. Ask Brown if he knows anything about stone tablets.
End.
