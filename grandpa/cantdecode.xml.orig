Have you been able to translate the carvings Grandpa?
Sadly no, Son. I'm not able to translate the writings. I tried everything I know.
What are we going to do now?
I might know someone who can help us. Your magic teacher Leonard. I think he will be able to decipher the secret of this stone tablet. Take the tablet with you and visit Leonard.
 I will be back as soon as possible Grandpa!
