Tell me the truth about Darkwood, Grandpa.
Well, my boy, I knew the time would come when I had to tell you about the woods. Evil wizards made use of this place. The woods hid them from the world so they could do whatever their hearts desired. They did countless horrible things here. I don't know the exact details, but I know that they sacrificed innocents during their dark rituals here. They obey Nasrus, the god that might be the next Mad God.
Why did they chose this place?
This place was touched by the Gods centuries ago. Their energy flows through the woods even today. Dark wizards can use this energy in their rituals.  Barnabas even says that the plants grow faster here.
Touched by the gods?
I don't know for sure, but the ancient legends say that there are many secrets in these woods. There had to be a good reason for the Gods to come down here and interfere with mortals.
Why is that no one came after us?
King Triston was the only one who was brave enough to say enough is enough. He gathered his Red Army and slaughtered everyone here. Legends say they killed everyone in the woods, even the children, because they could not be sure of who was evil and who wasn't. People stay far away from this place because they think that the evil deeds might happen again one day. They even say that the woods smelled of blood for a long time after the massacre.
I think I've heard enough. Now I understand. This place gives us protection because the outside world fears the woods.
You're right, my boy. This is why we chose this place. And nothing bad has happened for almost twenty years now. Something big is going to happen, I can feel it.
End.
