Where can I buy materials?
You will need nails, wood, and a decent door handle. Wood you can find everywhere, but a door handle and some sturdy nails need to be made by a blacksmith. Go to Aron. He will sell you the things you need. Also, you could visit your carpenter master, Jones. He might help you with the more delicate jobs.
Thank you, Grandpa. I'll chop down the wood we need and visit Aron for the goods.
