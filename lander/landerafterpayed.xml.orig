You have a familiar looking armor. I saw armor like that somewhere.
I'm one of the bear hunters. Where did you see similar armor?
I...(I should not tell him about Fox) I saw it many years ago on a traveler. I don't know his name.
Might have been one of us. Our clan dissolved a long time ago. Once we were proud hunters of the lands. We even protected the villages from all kinds of creatures like bears and golems. People loved us. Women loved us. Ha ha!
What are you doing now?
Nothing, as you see. The rebels keep things in order, if you can call their ways order. I spend most of my time down here with the lads. My hunting days are long gone.
Can you teach me?
That I can do. What would you like to know?
End.
