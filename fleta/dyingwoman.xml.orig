Can I help you? You look awfully sick. Your eyes are deep yellow.
Dear child, don't worry. A horrible disease is eating me away from inside. I think I have only a few days left. I'm dying.
There has to be something I can do! I'll ask my alchemy teacher, Brown; he might know a potion that can save you. I'll be back.
