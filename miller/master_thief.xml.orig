Who are you?
How did you get past my traps?
It wasn't that hard. The blood and bones kind of gave away the traps. As for the other ones, you just had to look really close where not to step.
Finally someone with brains. Well, on second thoughts, this simply means you have more intelligence than the wild animals that came near my home. My name is Miller. What do you want?
Why do you have all those statues outside your house?
For fun. I stole them for fun. I love playing tricks on the crazy village.
Crazy village?
The village to the far east. They are religious fools. They think that the gods will always help us and praying to them is the best thing that we can do while we are alive. Fools, if you ask me. Did they forget why we are living in this place?
Why do you have a problem with people who have faith?
Because where religion is strong there has to be someone who preaches. And usually the man or woman who preaches is immensely rich. In my type of work we like rich people.
So, you are a thief?
See, I knew you can use your brains. Yes I'm a thief.
Can you teach me anything?
I could teach you how to create lock picks. If you do me a favour. Do you know that imbecile Rhys? He tells everyone that he is such a great burglar, but in reality he couldn't even steal candy from a child. The only reason he is more interesting than a simple cow is because of his parents. His parents were true legends amongst the thieves.
I know him. He lives in our village. I have been suspicious of him, since he's never worked a day in his life.
He has a book that he brags about. The book supposedly is written by a great thief with lots of useful tricks in it. Steal that book from him and bring it back to me. If you do this I will teach you.
Where is this book?
He keeps it somewhere in his house. It shouldn't be that difficult to locate it.
I'll bring you that book.
