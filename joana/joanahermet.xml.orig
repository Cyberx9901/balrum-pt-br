Nice to meet you.
Looks like I have to increase the number of traps around the house again. What do you want?
Why are you living here alone?
How do you know I'm alone?
I don't know.
Exactly, you don't know. For your information I'm not on my own here. Me and my husband live here together. Far away from the filth of the city.
I've been to the city and it's not that bad there.
Good for you. Let me ask you again. What do you want?
I'm looking for work, and also, can you tell me where the path goes?
To the desert. It's a harsh and unforgiving land. At first it looks like a beautiful oasis but as you get deeper there won't be anything but sand. I have no idea why someone would choose to live there.
Who lives there?
Orran. The old sailor was not the sharpest tool in the shed. He decided to flee the city when the rebels took over. I don't think he's still alive. You said you're looking for work. I have something for you, if you are interested?
I might visit this Orran. I hope he's not dead. What can I help you with?
I would love to have a few flameberries! Funny we just talked about the desert because you can only find them there. Bring me five flameberries. I can pay you a little for your troubles.
I will be back with the berries.
I'm not going to the desert for a few berries.
