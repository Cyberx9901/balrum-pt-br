Ulger needs an apprentice in his new smithy.
A smithy? Where? How did I miss this?
I built a smithy for him in a cave nearby. Let me show you where it is on your map. He is a foreign blacksmith and he would very much like if you joined him.
Of course! Thank you! Thank you so much. I will go and join him as soon as possible.
Don't talk about this to anyone. If the rebels get hold of him they will kill him.
I understand.
End.
