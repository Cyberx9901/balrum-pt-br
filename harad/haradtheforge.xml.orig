What are you making here?
Not much, young man. Ever since my master left, this forge here is not being used.
Where is your master?
The rebels demanded too much. He left the realm a long time ago. I keep this place clean and sometimes even try to make something. Just when I started to learn the art of blacksmithing the rebels invaded the city.
Sad to hear that. Take care.
