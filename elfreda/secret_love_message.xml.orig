I have a message for you, Elfreda.
A message? What is it? Is it bad?
No it's good. Really good. Bingham told me to tell you that you are the most beautiful being in the whole of Balrum.
Bingham told me to tell you that you are the most horrible person he's ever met.
Bingham? Finally he's done something. I knew he liked me. The way he looked at me. A woman knows, you know. Tell him that he needs to be more courageous if he wants to keep talking to me.
What? He told you that? Now why would he say that? Ask him why he said that.
End.
