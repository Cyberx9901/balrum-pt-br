You need stone essence for your golem!
A stone essence you say? Hmm, interesting. That might even work!
Do you have one?
I don't know. I don't think so. The miners of Balrum found a few. The large mine is just east from here. You should ask around there. You get me one! Yes!
If I do this for you would you tell Van that you want me to be a member of your guild?
Yes, I will. You have been a great help so far. If you bring me a stone essence I will tell Van about how much help you were!
I will be back with the essence.
