Enjoying the party?
I haven't seen you here. You are new, aren't you?
Yes I am. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure. It's nice to see a new face. These parties need more young men like yourself. The rebels are dumb and smelly. You are quite the opposite. Lately, for some mysterious reason there are fewer and fewer people showing up at this party.
Thank you. Would you drink something with me?
I feared you would never ask.
End.
