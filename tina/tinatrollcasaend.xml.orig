The girls have found themselves the perfect man. A troll.
What? What are you talking about?
They found a friendly troll in the woods and they are staying there with him. They told me that they have everything they need and there is nothing to be worried about.
My word. They were even worse than I thought. Disgusting! The profanity! I don't want to hear more. Thank you for discovering the truth.
End.
