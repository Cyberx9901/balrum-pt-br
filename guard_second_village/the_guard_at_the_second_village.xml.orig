I need to talk to your leader.
You are not one of us. Who are you?
I'm from the other village.
Another infidel from Arlo's pack. What do you want with Kyler?
Something horrible is happening in our village. Wilson, Arlo's henchman, told me that Kyler should be able to shed some light on the things that have happened. Innocent lives are in danger.
I hear you boy and I believe you. Trying to help others is always a noble thing. But I cannot let you through until I know for sure that you can be trusted.
How can I prove to you that I am trustworthy?
Well. The other day when I was off duty I went exploring the old village. I thought I might find something of value. Instead of finding something that I can sell for a good price I lost my family ring. I was almost in the middle of the ruins when giant spiders attacked me. There were many of them but I fought myself through a few of them and managed to escape. Only when it was too late did I realise that I'd lost my ring. It must still be there somewhere. That ring has been in my family for many generations. Passed down from father to son. It's not a valuable ring, but to me it is so important. My hand is strangely cold without it. No one will help me retrieve it. Maybe you could find it? If you bring me my ring back, I will let you in!
We don't have time for this!
Fine, if you won't help me than I can't help you either.
You leave me no choice. I will try to find your ring. But if this diversion costs people's lives, you are to blame.
Then you need to hurry. I marked your map!
End.
