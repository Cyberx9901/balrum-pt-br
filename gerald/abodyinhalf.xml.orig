How can you be alive?
Kill me.
I might be able to help you! 
I've been here for countless years. Please kill me.
Who are you?
I'm one of King Triston's soldiers. The monstrous things we did. Our commander told us that we cannot be certain who is evil and who is innocent. We slaughtered everyone. Even the children. I remember the face of a beautiful young woman. She was right where you are standing. She was staring at me. I was covered in blood. The woman looked me right in the eye and said 'You will never kill us all'. Then she sliced me in half. The pain! I feel the pain! For how many years.. I still feel the pain. She put a spell on me so I could not move. And she forced me to drink a potion. I understand now. I deserve it. We were just like them. Taking innocent lives.
How can I help you?
Please kill me! This is the only thing you can do for me.
I won't kill you. You deserve to rot for all eternity.
I shall do what you ask.
