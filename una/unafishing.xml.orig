The smell of fish is really strong here.
You don't say.
Has anything interesting happened lately?
Not much.
Can I help you with something?
Yes you can. I need some good quality linen for my nets. They are getting old and the holes on them are getting too big.
Where can I get you the linen you need?
Just south from here is the large flax farm. They should have plenty of linen. Ask around there if you have trouble finding some for me. I cannot give you anything in return. Twelve pieces should do the trick.
I'll see what I can do.
I don't care about your nets.
You should because those nets put food on people's tables.
End.
How noble of you to help me for free! I'll look around. I'm sure I can find you something worth your time.
End.
