You look upset. What's the problem?
Welcome traveler. I assume you come in peace. You are right. I am upset. There is a large crocodile killing our people. We lived in harmony with the wild creatures for centuries but this horrible beast keeps attacking our fishers.
Where can I find the beast?
What will you do? We don't want to kill the creature. It will only anger the other ones.
There is no other choice. The beast is a danger to your village. Think about the children.
You are right traveler. Thank you for opening my eyes. If you do this task I will reward you with a special item. My ancestors received the key to the crypt near our village from your ancestors many centuries ago. I will give you that key.
I will slay the beast.
